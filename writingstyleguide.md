## WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

* Avoid the use of exclamation marks.
* Whenever possible, image captions and callouts should be complete sentences. 
* Write in a conversational style. Use short, simple sentences. Divide complex sentences. Sentence fragments can be OK.

**Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms** Only abbreviate and use acronyms or initialisms after first providing the full name. After the full name is providedm subsequent references can be abbreviated. 

>Correct: The campus Virtual Private Network (VPN)...

**End Punctuation** All image captions and callouts should end in a period, even when the callout is an incomplete sentence (for consistency). Don’t use end punctuation in headlines, headings, subheadings, UI titles, UI text, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item). 

 **Questions:**

 * When should statements in text screens end with a period? Any time they are a
 complete sentence?
 * An inline heading could have end punctuation.

 **Example.** This is an example of a paragraph with an inline heading.

## Capitalization and Punctuation in App Screens

Each App can have its own style rules for text. In the Illinois app and Safer Illinois app, we have established the following guidelines.

* Buttons use title case.
* Screen Titles use title case.
* Commands in screens use sentence case.
* Section headings in screens use title case.
* Drop-down menus use title case.
* Sentences within the body of a screen use end punctuation. 
* Sentences in a title do not have end punctuation, unless they are periods.
* Screen titles that are complete sentences (e.g., “Who are you?”) use sentence case. 


**Examples of Title and Sentence Case**

Title case means, basically, to capitalize the first letter of major words. Minor words, which are not capitalized, are prepositions (e.g., by, for, in), conjunctions (and, but, or), and articles (a, the). 

_Title Case_
Current Illini Cash Balance
Events for You
Who Are You?

_Sentence Case_
Current Illini cash balance
Events for you
Who are you?

**Example: Quick Polls Screen**

![Alt text](/Images/qpoll.png?raw=true "Quick Polls")

>In the Quick Polls screen from the Illinois app, above, some of the text is consistent with our style rules, and some text is inconsistent.
>
>_Consistent with Style_
>
>**Title:** **Create a Quick Poll** uses title case, which is correct.
>
>_Inconsistent with Style_
>
>**Heading:** **Additional settings** uses sentence case, which is incorrect.
>
>**Buttons:** **Add option** and **Start poll!** Both use sentence case, which is incorrect. (Also, the exclamation mark is unnecessary.)

**Example: Wallet Screen**

![Alt text](/Images/wallet.png?raw=true "Wallet")

>>In the Wallet screen from the Illinois app, above, some of the text is consistent with our style rules, and some text is inconsistent.
>
>_Consistent with Style_
>
>**Title:** **Wallet** uses title case. 
>**Sub-Heading:** **Current Illini Cash Balance** uses title case. 
>**Sub-Heading:** **Meals Remaining** uses title case.
>**Sub-Heading:** **Café Credits** uses title case.
>
>_Inconsistent with Style_
>
>**Heading:** **ILLINI CASH** and **MEAL PLAN** are styled in all-caps by design choice to help them stand out. They would otherwise be in title case. This is an intentional exception and not an error. 
>
>**Button:** **Use bus pass** uses sentence case and should be in title case. This is incorrect.


## Accessibility
To facilitate screen readers, observe the following guidelines.

* Provide alt text for all images.
* Embed hyperlinks in a noun or noun phrase rather than displaying the URL in the text.

## Concepts

**Contact Tracing** Contact tracing is a public health procedure used to identify people
who may have come into contact with an infected person. Conventional contact
tracing suppresses the spread of disease by finding infected people and isolating and
treating them. The public health workers who conduct contact tracing interview known
infected individuals, attempt to find all recent contacts with the infected individual, and
then follow up with those contacts with testing, isolation, treatment and other
measures.

The Safer Illinois app uses Bluetooth technology in an anonymous process that lets
people know if they have recent come into contact with a person who has been
diagnosed as being infected with the disease. The Illinois app does not do contact
tracing, because the Illinois app has no way of identifying individuals who are using the
app.

_AVOID:_ When describing the exposure notification capabilities of the Safer Illinois
app, do not use “contact tracing”, “digital contact tracing”, “track-and-trace”. Instead,
use “digital exposure notification” or “exposure notification”.


**Safer Illinois App Description**

**Short Version**
Safer Illinois is the official COVID-19 app for Champaign County residents and the
University of Illinois. The app provides pandemic resources to support community
health and safety.

**Long Version**
Safer Illinois is the official COVID-19 app for Champaign County residents and the
University of Illinois. The app provides pandemic resources to support community
health and safety.

* The app allows you to retrieve your virus test results, manage future tests, and make contact with health response teams and health care providers.

* You can use the app to access information about test locations and COVID-
guidelines for your county.

* A symptom scale supports automated self assessments.

* Exposure notification warns of possible contact with infected individuals through anonymous proximity tracing.

**Ideas and Phrases Used in the Safer Illinois app.**

Join the fight against COVID-19. Track and manage your health to help keep our Illinois
community safe.

You can use this app as your companion in your fight against COVID-19.

Help stop the spread of COVID-19 by following these current guidelines.

**Other Phrases:**

Diagnostic test - don't use.

Anonymous proximity tracing

confidential proximity detection (currently we use this phrase in FAQs)


Quarantine vs Isolate: A couple of wording issues. Because Derrick tested positive, he’ll
have to isolate rather than quarantine. I know, it sounds like the same thing. You isolate
(by yourself) if you’ve tested positive. You quarantine if you’ve been exposed but have
not tested positive. In quarantine, you can be with others (I think).

Also, we have been told not to use the terms dorm or dorms. We are to call these
places residences or campus housing or mini estates or some other euphemism.

Use tap, not tap on


**Rokwire Taxonomy terms**

* Capability is this an internal developer term or a public term?
Internal developer term. It should refer to third party processing systems, such as Converge. (per Sandeep 2/5/21 - but check.)

* Health Center Building Block Health Center Building Block is a ....^

* Preferred public-facing term: ??^

* Data Store (could be secure database server)^

* Feature^

* Are there standard names for menus, panels, screens in app user interface^

**Reference**

Screen on Illinois App:
“Help keep Illinois safe. Join the fight against COVID-19 by tracking and managing
your health.”

# Notes from Others

Shontz, Douglas <dshontz@uillinois.edu>

All,

The FDA regulates anything that provides a diagnosis or guidance for treatment of a medical condi;on as
a “medical device,” and this includes so>ware. All FDA-regulated medical devices must have FDA
authoriza;on.

This is reason to remove any use of the word “diagnose” or “treat” from these so>ware packages. They
are not FDA-approved medical devices.

So the answer to the ques;on is, yes, using these terms in an unapproved medical device could create
liability for the University. There is interpreta;on involved in what’s considered a medical device and
what isn’t, so it’s not always clear cut. However, comparing the ease of changing a few words with the
poten;al risk to the University, this should be an easy call to stay well away from any indica;on that this
so>ware could be interpreted as a medical device.

Happy to clarify further on any points.

University Affiliate. Affiliates are predefined groups that are closely related to the university and
have been granted access to digital resources and therefore have a NetID with certain access
privileges. Also, it is useful to understand that UINs are simply an id number that carry no
access credentials of and by themselves. A NetID is a credential.

## - Credential stored as an encrypted environment variable

Version numbering for documentation: Use semantic versioning. Three digits (Major.Minor.Patch). 
Work in progress is indicated by a major number of zero (0.1.0) and also by pre-release tags alpha (a) and beata (b) and release candidate (rc). A build sequence might look like this: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 → 1.0b1, 1.0b2 (with some fixes), 1.0b3 (with more fixes) → 1.0rc1 (which, if it is stable enough), 1.0rc2 (if more bugs are found) → 1.0.
